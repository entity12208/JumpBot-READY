# Bot Customization
This bot has several customization options. If you don't know how to change the code, this folder has several premade code submods. 
The descriptions are listed (or will be soon) below.

## Usage
To use these submods, copy the code into a text file and place it into the geode folder. Though Geode will say there is a mod error, everything will work fine with this and other mods.

## Descriptions
* MegaHack.JumpBot - Makes disabled hacks from MegaHack v8 like macros and speedhack functional
