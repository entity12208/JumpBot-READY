# JumpBot
An easy-to-use auto macro for GD! 

## How to use
* Press "CTRL + J"
* Restart or play a level
* Wait until it's complete (you will likely die many times). DON'T TOUCH THE CONTROLS!
* Press "CTRL + J" to it shut off (it will save the level's jump pattern)
### Note
This bot saves plays as a text file. Editing *any* of these files can cause a temporary bug where the play can't jump. Please leave these files alone!
